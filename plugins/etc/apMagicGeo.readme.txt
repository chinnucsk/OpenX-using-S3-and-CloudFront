==========
The Geolocation Magic Macros plugin for OpenX, Magic Geo in short, enables you
to dynamically insert the name of the geographic location of a visitor into a
banner. This can be used in both the HTML code and the destination URL. Using
this new feature, you can automatically make a banner adjust its content to the
location of a visitor.
